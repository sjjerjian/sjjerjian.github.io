## Bikeshare demand prediction

![image](../assets/img/ride_counts_all_bydayofweek.png)

In 2023, I was lucky to take part in a data science fellowship program hosted by the Professional Development and Careers Office at Johns Hopkins and run by several PhD graduates from JHU now working in data science. For 8 weeks, I worked part-time on a self-guided project, for which I chose to try and build a model to forecast demand in the D.C. Capital Bikeshare system.

## Neuroscience Conference Feedback Survey Results Dashboard

In late 2015 - early 2016, I led the organisation and delivery of a student neuroscience conference in London. To assess the success of the project and guide future student conference organizers, I put together and sent out a feedback survey, which received 215 responses (~60% of total attendees). Using the anonymized data, I put together the main results from the feedback survey in a Tableau Dashboard.
