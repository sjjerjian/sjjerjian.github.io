I am a data scientist at Biological Black Box Inc, a startup in Baltimore, Maryland.

Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral research scientist in the Mind/Brain Institute at Johns Hopkins University, studying the neural bases of multisensory decision-making.
I obtained a PhD in neuroscience from the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, and an undergraduate degree in Natural Sciences from University College London in the UK.

I am a lifelong Liverpool FC fan. Away from screens, I enjoy playing football, tennis, and piano, and practicing my Spanish.
